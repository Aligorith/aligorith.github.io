		<h1>An Empirical Evaluation of Collapsible Panel Interfaces</h1>
		
		<h1>Abstract</h1>
		<p>Although collapsible panel widgets have been widely used in industry for many years in various contexts, there have been no formal evaluations conducted to compare user performance and satisfaction with these interfaces. There is also a lack of formal guidance for user interface designers about how to choose among the many variations of collapsible panel schemes in existence. In this paper, we develop a classification framework and propose an empirical method for evaluating user performance with these interfaces. An experiment was conducted comparing accordions, collapsible panels, and flat panel layouts. This found a clear preference for accordions, with the need to scroll to find targets in the other interfaces cited as a key disadvantage of those approaches. Implications of these findings are discussed.

		<h2>Demo Implementation</h2>
		<p>Here is a Python 3 + PyQt5 demo application demonstrating the behaviour of several different Collapsible Panel interfaces (as shown below).</p>

		<p>There are subtle differences between the PyQt5 interfaces and the original PyQt4 ones used in the experiments. The code above has had the necessary changes made to make it be able to run under modern Python 3 + PyQt5 environments (as of December 2020), as it is no longer possible to easily set up the original environment (i.e. due to dead links to binary packages).</p>
