He is passionate about developing new tools for character animation which help artists achieve their creative goals easier and faster than ever before.</p>
		
		<p>From 2009-2012, Joshua studied Computer Science at the University of Canterbury, graduating with a Bachelor of Science with First Class Honours on 12 December 2012 (12-12-12). In 2017, he completed a <a href="research/phd/phd_thesis.html">PhD</a> in Computer Science (specialising in Human-Computer Interaction) in the <a href="http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/research/RG/HCI/HCIlab/">HCI and Multimedia Lab</a> (supervised by <a href="mailto: andy@cosc.canterbury.ac.nz">Prof Andy Cockburn</a>), focussing on understanding how the noticeability and distraction characteristics of interactive highlighting techniques can be objectively catalogued and quantified.</p>
		
		<p>Previously, Joshua was also a violinist whose teachers included Oleg Kotorovych (Assistant Concertmaster, CSO), Iryna Ionenko (Principal Second Violin, CSO), and Robin Wilson. He was awarded with a DipABRSM in 2006, LTCL with Distinction in 2007, and FTCL in 2008.
